Report Structure
Your report should follow a clear and structured format to document both core and advanced features:

1. Introduction

Overview of the project.
Purpose of the synthesiser.
Brief description of core and advanced features.
2. Core Functionality (From Labs 1 & 2)

Waveform Generation (Sawtooth wave implementation).
Input Handling (Key press detection, CAN bus communication).
Output Handling (DAC/PWM for audio output, OLED display).
Concurrency (Use of interrupts and threads).
3. Advanced Features

For each advanced feature:

Description (What it does and why it improves the synthesiser).
Implementation Details (Code structure, algorithms used).
Real-Time Considerations (Ensuring it meets timing constraints).
Hardware Utilization (How it efficiently uses microcontroller resources).
4. Performance Analysis

CPU Utilization (Total processing load and efficiency).
Timing Analysis (Task execution times and worst-case execution time).
Rate Monotonic Scheduling (Ensuring real-time deadlines are met).
Synchronization & Data Protection (Shared resources and mutual exclusion methods).
5. Testing & Validation

Test Cases for Core and Advanced Features.
Measured vs. Expected Performance.
Bugs Found and Fixes.
6. Conclusion & Future Work

Summary of achievements.
Potential improvements or additional features.
7. References

Datasheets, libraries, and any external resources used.
This structure ensures clarity, demonstrates software engineering best practices, and covers all required documentation specifications
