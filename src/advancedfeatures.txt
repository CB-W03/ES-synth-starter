Advanced Features for Your Synthesiser
Since your synthesiser already meets all core functional requirements, you can implement advanced features that enhance its functionality while maintaining real-time constraints. Here are some ideas:

1. Polyphony (Multiple Notes Simultaneously)

Implementation: Modify your waveform generation system to handle multiple concurrent notes, summing their signals.
Challenges: Prevent CPU overload by limiting polyphony to a reasonable number of voices.
Hardware Utilization: Use DMA and timers to efficiently mix and output multiple waveforms.

2. Envelope Generator (ADSR)

Implementation: Implement an Attack, Decay, Sustain, Release (ADSR) envelope to shape each note's amplitude over time.
Challenges: Must ensure real-time constraints; envelope updates must be scheduled efficiently.
Hardware Utilization: Use a timer or low-priority thread to update the envelope.

3. Waveform Selection (Sine, Square, Triangle, etc.)

Implementation: Allow users to select different waveforms via a rotary encoder or button input.
Challenges: Efficient waveform generation and switching in real time.
Hardware Utilization: Use a precomputed lookup table (LUT) for smooth waveform generation.

4. MIDI Input and Output

Implementation: Support MIDI messages over USB or UART to communicate with external instruments.
Challenges: Parsing MIDI messages efficiently without interfering with audio processing.
Hardware Utilization: Use UART interrupts to handle MIDI input asynchronously.

5. Effects Processing (Reverb, Delay, Chorus)

Implementation: Apply real-time DSP effects to the sound output.
Challenges: Real-time processing constraints and CPU load.
Hardware Utilization: Use a dedicated DSP algorithm or leverage hardware features like DMA.

6. Visualizer on OLED Display

Implementation: Show a real-time waveform or frequency spectrum of the generated sound.
Challenges: Processing the waveform fast enough to update the display without affecting audio.
Hardware Utilization: Use FFT for spectral analysis and optimize OLED refresh rates.
