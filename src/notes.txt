For our implementaiton of the scanKeys (without polyphony) function the total time to execute 32 iterations is 2822 microseconds.
Which translates to taking approximately 88.2 microseconds (3 s.f.) per execution of the function 
which is within the range of the sanity check (50 - 100 microseconds)

Our implementation of the displayUpdate function takes 512908 microseconds to execute 32 iterations
This translates to approximately 16028 microseconds, or ~16 milliseconds whenever the function is executed

The implementation of the decodeTask function takes 141 microseconds to be executed 32 times.
Which means each function call takes approximately 4.41 microseconds (3 s.f.)

CAN_TASK takes 27620 microseconds to execute 32 times
meaning each function call takes approximately 863 microseconds
